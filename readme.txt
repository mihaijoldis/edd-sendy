== Description ==

Your subscriber base is growing and so is the cost per campaign. Going for the monthly plan means wasting more money if you don't send newsletters regularly enough.

You're stuck. The bigger your subscriber base becomes, the more expensive it is to communicate with them. What if you can send without worrying about cost or deliverability?

Meet Sendy.

[Sendy](http://sendy.co/?ref=VLF1H) is a self hosted email newsletter application that lets you send trackable emails via Amazon Simple Email Service (SES). This makes it possible for you to send authenticated bulk emails at an insanely low price without sacrificing deliverability.

Setting up Sendy is easy, and there's even a great guide available to help get you started: http://davekiss.com/create-your-own-mailchimp-clone-for-5-a-month-with-sendy/

This extension integrates your Easy Digital Downloads store with Sendy by letting you automatically subscribe customers to specific lists based on what they purchased, and allowing customers to opt themselves into a list during checkout.

You can enable a “global” newsletter list, which all customers can have the option of signing up for during checkout. You can also select one or more lists that customers will be automatically subscribed to when purchasing specific products.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `edd-sendy.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
